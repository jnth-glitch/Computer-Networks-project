# Computer-Networks-project
This project focuses on comparison and analysis of 3 MANET protocols namely, Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)
These above mentioned protocols are implemented in tcl scripts and simulated using NS2 simulator.
These protocols are compared in 3 networks which differ by number of nodes. 
Networks 1, 2 and 3 consists of 10, 15 and 20 nodes respectively.
